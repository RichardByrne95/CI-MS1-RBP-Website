-   ###Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colour scheme of RBP is orange (#FF8400), white (#FFF), red (#C41230), and black (#000).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The primary font used throughout the site is Proxima Nova, with Sans-Serif as the fallback font. However, Montserrat and Josefin-Sans are used for the headings of each page, both, again, with a fallback of Sans-Serif.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Despite the site having a minimalist feel, the imagery is very important to the user expierence. It is designed to both inform the visitor of what they can expect when recording and give them a deeper understanding of the brand. The large hero image was chosen to be such, so as to grab the user's attention, as well as to put the brand experience at the forefront of the visitor's attention.
